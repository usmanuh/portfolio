# Virtualisation Basics with VirtualBox
This project documents real operational tasks performed in a Systems Administrator capacity, focusing on the setup, management and testing of isolated environments using local virtualisation tools.

The objective was to configure secure virtual machines, install test software in an isolated environment and practice snapshot-based rollback procedures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview
As part of internal IT operations, the following actions were completed:

- Installed Oracle VirtualBox and obtained a stable Ubuntu ISO image for operating system installation.
- Provisioned a virtual machine with 2 GB RAM, 1 CPU core and a 20 GB dynamically allocated virtual disk.
- Successfully installed and configured Ubuntu 22.04 within the virtual machine environment.
- Captured a clean state snapshot to enable fast recovery before making changes or installing new software.
- Deployed and tested the system monitor tool `htop` to verify Linux CLI package installation within the VM.
- Practised rollback procedures using snapshots to restore the VM to a stable state.

## üìä Outcomes
- Developed hands-on experience with virtual machine setup and administration.
- Demonstrated secure OS installation and software testing in an isolated environment.
- Applied snapshot strategies to support rapid recovery and troubleshooting.
- Strengthened local virtualisation management capabilities aligned with IT operational workflows.

## üìö Key Skills Applied
- Oracle VirtualBox Administration
- Ubuntu Linux Installation and Configuration
- VM Resource Allocation and Disk Management
- Snapshot Creation and Rollback
- Software Installation using Linux CLI
